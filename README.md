# Global-Arena-Research-Institute-GARI-TASK-1

International trade is an important indicator of globalisation. We want to assess how particular countries are involved in the process. To find out we need to look at the volume of international trade which flows from and flows to the particular countries. In this task, we will use data from UN COMTRADE Database focus on the international trade in services (Trade Value (US$) for Total EBOPS Services).
Your task is to
create a dataset containing data for all countries in the time period 1990 - 2020 - their overall exports and imports of services (partner country - World) and use API to access the data
pre-process and clean dataset
create a group of 10 countries which are the most involved in international trade in services and 10 which are the least involved and prepare a visualisation supporting your choice and visualisation of the development of trade over years in those countries
Expectations
When submitting completed tasks, include the following:
Documentation of your thought process in written form
The runnable code used to obtain, and, if necessary, to clean and preprocess the dataset and create the visualisations
